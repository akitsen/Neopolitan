Neapolitan - Senior Project
===========

This was part of my senior project at Westmont College to create a platform for free speech and communication on the Westmont College campus.

Initially meant to provide an anonymous place for individuals to ask question, share info and poll on popular issues. I wanted to address this due to my experience as 
a transfer student who was unable to voice my questions and opinions without leaving embarrassed at the end. Never took off due to other popular applications such as YikYak and Reddit, but it was a fun project nonetheless.

Ended up using Ruby on Rails because it was a new and exciting platform that I wanted to learn.
